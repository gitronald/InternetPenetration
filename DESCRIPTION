Description: This package was created to connect the user to the World Bank's World Development Indicators
  [WDI] API, download a subset of WDI data for Internet penetration, and then reshape and plot it as a
  gradient over a blank world map. The functions developed could potentially be extended to other World Bank
  data with minimal changes.
